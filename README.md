# Project Description
This project is a full-stack application built using Express and Node.js on the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database. It leverages Sequelize as the ORM for managing database operations and was thoroughly tested using Postman API. The application performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently, ensuring robust data management. The frontend will be developed using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
